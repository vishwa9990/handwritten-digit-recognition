Handwritten Digit Recognition is the process of digitizing human handwritten digit images. It is a difficult task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with a variety of flavors. In order to address this issue, we created HDR, which uses the image of a digit to identify the digit that is present in the image.
